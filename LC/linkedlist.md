## 1. 📘 What is a Linked List?

A **linked list** is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next. It's commonly used in LeetCode problems because it's good for dynamic memory, insertions/deletions.

## 2. 🧱 Basic Node Structure in Java

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;

    ListNode() {} // default constructor
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
}
```

You’ll use this class constantly on LeetCode.

## 4. 🔧 Techniques You Must Know

### ✅ 1. Traversal

```java
ListNode current = head;
while (current != null) {
    System.out.println(current.val);
    current = current.next;
}
```

---

### ✅ 2. Find Length of List

```java
int length = 0;
ListNode current = head;
while (current != null) {
    length++;
    current = current.next;
}
```

---

### ✅ 3. Reverse a List

```java
ListNode prev = null;
ListNode curr = head;

while (curr != null) {
    ListNode next = curr.next;
    curr.next = prev;
    prev = curr;
    curr = next;
}

// return prev as new head
```

---

### ✅ 4. Find Middle of List (Two Pointers)

```java
ListNode slow = head;
ListNode fast = head;

while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;

Here’s a **quick conceptual breakdown** of each of those popular Linked List problems on LeetCode — no code, just the core idea behind the solution:

---

### ✅ Reverse Linked List

* **Idea**: Change the direction of all `.next` pointers so the list runs backward.
* **Approach**: Use a loop or recursion to reverse the pointers one by one.

---

### ✅ Merge Two Sorted Lists

* **Idea**: Combine two sorted linked lists into one sorted list by comparing nodes.
* **Approach**: Use two pointers and a dummy node to build the result in-place.

---

### ✅ Linked List Cycle

* **Idea**: Check if a list has a cycle (loop).
* **Approach**: Use two pointers (slow and fast); if they ever meet, there’s a cycle.

---

### ✅ Reorder List

* **Idea**: Rearrange nodes from `L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2...`
* **Approach**: Find the middle, reverse the second half, and interleave the two halves.

---

### ✅ Remove Nth Node From End of List

* **Idea**: Remove the nth node from the end in one pass.
* **Approach**: Use two pointers with a gap of n steps, then remove the target node.

---

### ✅ Copy List With Random Pointer

* **Idea**: Deep copy a list where each node has a `.next` and `.random` pointer.
* **Approach**: Clone each node and use a hash map or interleave nodes to copy random links.

---

### ✅ Add Two Numbers

* **Idea**: Add two numbers represented as reversed linked lists (like digit by digit).
* **Approach**: Simulate digit-wise addition, managing carry and node traversal.

---

### ✅ Find The Duplicate Number

* **Idea**: Given an array, find the single duplicate number.
* **Approach**: Treat array as linked list and detect a cycle using Floyd's algorithm.

---

### ✅ LRU Cache

* **Idea**: Implement a Least Recently Used cache with fast access and eviction.
* **Approach**: Use a doubly linked list + hash map to support O(1) get/put operations.

---

### ✅ Merge K Sorted Lists

* **Idea**: Merge multiple sorted lists into one.
* **Approach**: Use a min-heap (priority queue) to always pick the smallest head node.

---

### ✅ Reverse Nodes in k-Group

* **Idea**: Reverse nodes in chunks of k.
* **Approach**: Traverse the list in k-sized groups, reverse each group, and reconnect.

---
Absolutely — here’s a **step-by-step approach** for each problem, focusing on *how* to solve it (but still no code):

---

### 🔁 **1. Reverse Linked List**

* Initialize two pointers: `prev` and `curr`.
* Loop through the list:

  * Store the next node temporarily.
  * Change `curr.next` to point to `prev`.
  * Move both pointers forward.
* At the end, `prev` will be the new head.

---

### 🔀 **2. Merge Two Sorted Lists**

* Use two pointers to iterate through both lists.
* Compare the current nodes and attach the smaller one to the merged list.
* Advance the pointer of the list you took the node from.
* When one list is exhausted, append the rest of the other list.

---

### 🔄 **3. Linked List Cycle**

* Use slow and fast pointers.
* Move `slow` one step, `fast` two steps.
* If they ever meet, there's a cycle.
* To find the start of the cycle (if required), reset one pointer to the head and move both one step at a time.

---

### 🔁 **4. Reorder List**

* Find the middle of the list using slow and fast pointers.
* Reverse the second half of the list.
* Merge the first and second halves by alternating nodes.

---

### 🧽 **5. Remove Nth Node From End of List**

* Use two pointers with `n` steps between them.
* Advance both until the leading pointer hits the end.
* The trailing pointer will be just before the node to remove.
* Adjust pointers to skip the target node.

---

### 🧬 **6. Copy List With Random Pointer**

* First pass: Create new nodes and interleave them with the original nodes.
* Second pass: Set the `.random` pointers for the new nodes.
* Third pass: Separate the original and copied nodes into two distinct lists.

---

### ➕ **7. Add Two Numbers**

* Simulate the addition as if adding two numbers digit-by-digit.
* Start from the head (least significant digit).
* Keep track of carry.
* Create new nodes for the result as you go.

---

### 🔍 **8. Find The Duplicate Number**

* Treat the array as a linked list where `nums[i]` points to the next index.
* Use cycle detection (slow/fast pointers) to find the duplicate.
* Once a cycle is found, reset one pointer to the start and find the entry point of the cycle.

---

### 🧠 **9. LRU Cache**

* Use a hash map for O(1) key lookups.
* Use a doubly linked list to track the usage order of keys.
* On access: move the key to the front (most recently used).
* On insertion: if full, remove the tail (least recently used) and insert new at front.

---

### 🧮 **10. Merge K Sorted Lists**

* Use a min-heap (priority queue) to store the heads of all lists.
* Pop the smallest node from the heap and add it to the merged list.
* Push the next node from the same list into the heap.
* Repeat until heap is empty.

---

### 🔃 **11. Reverse Nodes in k-Group**

* Traverse the list and check if there are at least `k` nodes ahead.
* Reverse the `k` nodes as a group.
* Reconnect the reversed part with the rest of the list.
* Repeat the process for the next group of `k`.
