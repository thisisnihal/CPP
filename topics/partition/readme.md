Partitioning arrays is a common theme in coding problems, especially in interviews and competitive programming. Struggling with it is normal at first‚Äîmastery comes from building intuition and pattern recognition.

Here's a step-by-step guide to **master partition array problems**:

## üîç 1. **Understand What ‚ÄúPartition‚Äù Really Means**

"Partition" just means **divide the array** into subarrays (or two parts) based on some condition. Common goals include:

* Equal sum (e.g., \[1, 5, 11, 5] ‚Üí \[1, 5, 5] and \[11])
* K subarrays with equal sum/size
* Partition by pivot (quick sort-style)
* Maximize/minimize something (e.g., min difference of two partitions)

## üß± 2. **Categorize Problem Types**

Here are the main **types of partition problems**:

| Type                         | Example Problem                                          | Key Concept            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Equal Sum Partition          | Can you partition array into two subsets with equal sum? | DP (Subset Sum)        |
| K Equal Sum Subsets          | Partition into K subsets of equal sum                    | Backtracking           |
| Maximize/Minimize Difference | Min difference between two subsets                       | DP                     |
| Dutch National Flag          | Partition into 3 groups (0s,1s,2s)                       | Two pointers           |
| Partition by Pivot           | Like in QuickSort                                        | In-place rearrangement |
| Continuous Subarrays         | Split into `k` subarrays to minimize max sum             | Binary Search + Greedy |

## üõ†Ô∏è 3. **Master These Core Techniques**

To solve 90% of partition problems, you need to learn:

### üßÆ Dynamic Programming (for subset-based problems)

* Practice subset sum variants:

  * Equal sum partition
  * Partition into k equal subsets
  * Min difference partition
* Tools: `dp[i][j]` = can we form sum `j` with first `i` items?

### üß™ Backtracking (for k-subsets or constraints)

* Used in: Partition to K equal sum subsets
* Try every possibility (prune with early checks)
* Track which elements are used (via boolean visited array)

### ‚ûó Prefix Sum / Greedy / Binary Search (for continuous partitions)

* Used in: Split array into k subarrays with minimized largest sum
* Combine binary search with greedy "can we split like this?"

### ‚ÜîÔ∏è Two pointers / Partitioning Logic

* Used in: Dutch national flag, partition by pivot
* In-place rearrangement: swap left/right while iterating

## üß† 5. **Build Intuition, Not Just Code**

For each problem:

1. **Ask yourself:**

   * What's the condition I'm trying to meet?
   * Is this about *subsets*, *subarrays*, or *in-place* partitioning?
2. **Draw out examples** by hand
3. **Recognize patterns**‚Äîeventually, you'll see the same problem shapes repeat

## üõ§Ô∏è 6. **Practice Plan (2 Weeks)**

| Day   | Task                                                                         |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2   | Subset sum & equal partition problems (Leetcode 416, 698)                    |
| 3-4   | Dutch flag & pivot partitioning (Leetcode 75, implement quicksort partition) |
| 5-6   | Binary search + greedy problems (Leetcode 410)                               |
| 7     | Review all and write down patterns you notice                                |
| 8-12  | Solve 1‚Äì2 medium/hard problems each day                                      |
| 13-14 | Take a mock interview with array partition problems                          |

## ‚úÖ Summary

To master array partitioning problems:

* **Recognize the category** (subset, subarray, in-place)
* **Learn key techniques** (DP, backtracking, binary search, two pointers)
* **Practice progressively**
* **Always review solutions and note patterns**
